**Files:**  
a_chunker = pickle file containing the trained model from Q1 part a  
b_chunker = pickel file containing the trained model from Q1 part b  
c_chunker = pickle file containing the trained model from Q1 part c  
HW3_test.txt = the given sentences to run the chunkers on  
a_chunker_results.txt = results from running chunker from part a on the HW3.txt sentences  
b_chunker_results.txt = results from running chunker from part b on the HW3.txt sentences  
c_chunker_results.txt = results from running chunker from part c on the HW3.txt sentences
